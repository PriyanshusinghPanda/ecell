## Setting up the Development Environment

**1. Create a Virtual Environment**

   - Open the Command Palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P** on Windows/Linux, **Cmd+Shift+P** on macOS).
   - Type "Python: Create Environment" and select it.
   - Choose "Venv" as the environment type. 
   - Select your preferred Python interpreter.
   - Click "Create".

**2. Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - Open the Command Palette.
   - Type "Python: Select Interpreter".
   - Select the newly created virtual environment from the list.

**3. Install Dependencies**

   - Open the terminal within VS Code.
   - Run the following command:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file into your virtual environment.

**Note:**

- Using a virtual environment ensures that your project's dependencies are isolated from other projects and the system's global Python environment.
- This setup provides a consistent and reproducible environment for development and testing.

By following these steps, you'll have a well-structured and informative section in your README.md file guiding users on setting up the development environment for your project.
